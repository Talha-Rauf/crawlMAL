# crawlMAL
This web crawler:
1- Searches the MAL (a.k.a. My Anime List) website based on the input anime name.
2- Shows up to the first five results and provides the option to pick one from them.
3- Displays the details according to the selected option.
4- Then allows an option to either save the information on a local file, continue with the search or exit the program.

NOTE: You might see some text that should not be a part of the information because this is the initial version of the project and will be fixed later on.
